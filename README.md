### Hi ðŸ‘‹ , I am Julio!


I am an infrastructure engineer currently working with Devops (Kubernetes, Docker, Isito etc.) and also interested in web development. I am always looking to learn and improve my skills through reading, self-knowledge and technical courses. I love working with technology and with great people that help me grow as a professional.
